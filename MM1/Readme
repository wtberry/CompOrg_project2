Simulation of M/M/1 queueing system
-----------------------------------

Description:  This program simulates an M/M/1 queueing system.  
The simulation outputs the number of customers in the queue after 
100000 departures from the system, and the average number of 
customers in the system over the entire simulation.

Platform/compiler: UNIX, g++

Files:

event.cpp - Functions for inserting and removing Events from EventLists 
event.h - Data structures for Events and EventLists
main.cpp - Main program for simulation
Makefile - Makefile for simulation
output - output of the simulation
rv.cpp - Functions which return uniform and exponential random variables
rv.h - Header file for rv.cpp

Compiling instructions:
Edit Makefile to point to the c++ compiler on the local machine.
To compile, place all files within a single directory and type "make".
To run, type "sim".
